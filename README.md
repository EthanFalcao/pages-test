# Hosting Your Website on GitHub Pages

This guide will help you host your website on GitHub Pages using a repository named `pages-test`.

## Steps to Host Your Website:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
- Create a new repository on GitHub, in this example, we are using  `pages-test`.

### 2. Prepare the Repository
- Ensure your HTML file is named `index.html` as GitHub Pages uses this file as the main page.
- Check your HTML file for any external links or references and make sure they use relative paths.

### 3. Push Your Changes to the Repository
- Use Git to commit and push your `index.html` file to your `pages-test` repository on GitHub.

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages
- Go to your `pages-test` repository on GitHub.
- Click on "Settings."
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Choose the source branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and select the `/ (root)` folder as the source.
- Save the settings.

### 5. Access Your Site
- After saving, GitHub Pages will provide a URL to access your hosted website. It will look something like: `https://yourusername.github.io/pages-test/`.

## Important Notes:
- Ensure any external resources used in your website are accessible from your GitHub repository.
- It might take a few moments for your site to go live on GitHub Pages after configuration.

Follow these steps to host your website on GitHub Pages. For more information, refer to GitHub's official documentation on Pages: [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
